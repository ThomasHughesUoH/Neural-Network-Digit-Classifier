# Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier

The "Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier" is an implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The program imports necessary libraries, loads the dataset, and splits it into training and testing sets. It then trains the MLP classifier on the training set and calculates its accuracy on the testing set.
