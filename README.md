# Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier
The "Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier" is a Python program that uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The program trains the MLP on the training set, calculates its accuracy on the testing set, and displays sample images from the dataset with their predicted labels.
