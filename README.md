# Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier

The "Neural-Network-Digit-Classifier" implements a digit classifier using a neural network and applies it to the MNIST dataset. It trains the classifier on a subset of the dataset, measures its accuracy and loss, and evaluates its performance on a testing set. The code also provides visualisations of the training process, including plots of accuracy and loss over epochs, as well as sample images with predicted and actual labels. Incorrect predictions are analysed to identify patterns and frequencies of errors. The code saves the predicted and actual labels to a CSV file and provides the functionality to load and analyse these predictions. Additionally, the code includes a feature that allows the classifier to learn to draw digits based on correctly identified instances. There is an interactive mode where users can input a digit and have the classifier draw it based on its learned knowledge.
